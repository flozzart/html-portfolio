<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m a passionate entrepreneur, creative thinker, and problem solver with big dreams and an even bigger drive to achieve them. I am the founder of Flozzart, a business dedicated to website design, graphic design, and branding. My journey in the world of creativity and business is just beginning, and I’m excited to build something that leaves a lasting impact. .</p>

<p>My biggest ambition is to become a successful businesswoman, growing Flozzart into a powerful brand while also exploring new opportunities. Apart from business, I have a deep admiration for detective work, as I love solving mysteries and uncovering hidden truths.  </p>

<p> I’m someone who loves keeping my mind and body active. Whether it’s reading books, playing games, cooking, listening to Madeh, or watching horror, thriller, and mystery movies, I find joy in every little experience. I also have a strong passion for sports, especially throwball, badminton, and table tennis, as they challenge me both physically and mentally. And of course, one of my favorite pastimes is irritating my little sister—because what’s life without a bit of sibling fun?</p>

<p> I believe in creating a meaningful life, where success isn’t just about personal achievements but also about helping others and making an impact. I want to build a legacy, make my family proud, and inspire others to chase their dreams fearlessly.

  Every day, I work towards becoming the best version of myself—pushing boundaries, embracing challenges, and striving for greatness. </p>
